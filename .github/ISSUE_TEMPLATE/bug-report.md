### \# System Information  
<!--- 
  OS:       Your operating system, architecture, etc. (If you're using Linux, include the distribution.)
  Version:  The version of ARRCON you're using. (You can find this by using the `ARRCON -v` command.)
  Shell:    I only require this if you're using Windows because of its problematic handling of ANSI sequences. If you use a terminal emulator, include its name & a link to it as well.
            It is likely one of these:
            - Command Prompt   (cmd.exe)
            - PowerShell       (PowerShell.exe)
            - PowerShell Core  (pwsh.exe)
