### \# Documentation Request  
- What is the documentation for?  
<!---
  This can be an existing feature in ARRCON, something on github, or documentation for source code.
--->

- Is there existing documentation?  
<!--- 
  If there is no existing documentation, put "No"
  If there is already related documentation, please describe where to find it, and why you found it confusing. 
  (I tend to have problems with word choice sometimes, so these reports are highly appreciated.)

- What changes would you want to see?
