A lightweight terminal-based remote console client compatible with any game using the Source RCON Protocol.  

ARRCON was inspired by [mcrcon by Tiiffi](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon), and will be familiar to anyone who has used mcrcon previously.  

# Features
  - Cross-Platform:
    - Windows
    - Linux
    - macOS
  - Works for any game using the [Source RCON Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol).
  - Handles large packets without issue.
  - Handles multi-packet responses without issue, and has configurable delays in the INI file.
  - Supports Minecraft Bukkit terminal colors using the section sign `ยง`.
  - Can be used as a one-off from the commandline, or in an interactive shell.
    - Supports piping input from STDIN using shell operators.  
      For example; `echo "help" | ARRCON -S myServer` would send the `help` command to the `myServer` host.
        - Commands from STDIN are sent _after_ any commands explicitly specified on the commandline.
    - Supports running external "scripts" using the `-f`\|`--file` option.
      - Commands are separated by newlines.
      - Commands from script files are sent _after_ any commands from STDIN.
  - Save & recall a server's IP/Hostname, port, and password directly from the commandline without editing files.  
    _Passwords are __never__ printed to the terminal._
    

# Download & Install
Get the latest version for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON/releases) page.

There is no installation process, simply extract the archive & it's ready to go.  
To use ARRCON without specifying the absolute filepath to it, you have to [add the location to your Path variable](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON/wiki/Adding-To-Path).

## Building from Source
See [here](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON/wiki/Building-from-Source) for a brief guide on building ARRCON from source.


# Usage
ARRCON is a CLI program, which means you need to run it through a terminal.  
On Windows, you can use `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` by R+Clicking on the start menu.  
For more detailed usage instructions, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON/wiki)

To see a list of commands, use `ARRCON -h` or `ARRCON --help`  
To see a list of environment variables, their current values, and a description of each, use `ARRCON --print-env`


## Modes
The operation mode is selected based on context, but can be influenced by some options.  
There are 2 modes:
- ___Interactive Shell___
  - Used by default when there are no command arguments.
  - Opens an interactive console session. You can send commands and view the responses in real-time.
  - Connection remains open until you disconnect or kill the process, or if the server closes.
- ___Commandline___
  - Executes a list of commands in order with a configurable delay between sending each packet.
  - You can also use the `-f <filepath>` or `--file <filepath>` options to specify a scriptfile, which is executed line-by-line after any commands passed on the commandline.
  - Supports shell pipeline operators (`|`, `|&`, etc.)
  - Supports STDIN input redirection. _(Input from STDIN is always considered to be a command)_
